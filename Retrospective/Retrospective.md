# TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 05)

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done =
- Total points committed vs. done =
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team) =

**Remember**a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:

- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End (and Integration) tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!)

### Detailed statistics

| Story           | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
| --------------- | ------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------ |
| _Uncategorized_ |         | -      |            |              |
| Get tickets     |         |        |            |              |
| Next customer   |         |        |            |              |
| Call customer   |         |        |            |              |

> story `Uncategorized` is for technical tasks, leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)

|            | Mean | StDev |
| ---------- | ---- | ----- |
| Estimation |      |       |
| Actual     |      |       |

- Total estimation error ratio: sum of total hours spent / sum of total hours effort - 1

  $$\frac{\sum_i spent_{task_i}}{\sum_i estimation_{task_i}} - 1$$ =

- Absolute relative task estimation error: sum( abs( spent-task-i / estimation-task-i - 1))/n

  $$\frac{1}{n}\sum_i^n \left| \frac{spent_{task_i}}{estimation_task_i}-1 \right| $$ =

## QUALITY MEASURES

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated =
  - Total hours spent =
  - Nr of automated unit test cases =
  - Coverage =
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated =
  - Total hours spent =
  - Nr of test cases =
- Code review
  - Total hours estimated =
  - Total hours spent =

## ASSESSMENT

- What did go wrong in the sprint?

  > We were not able to fully point out all the tasks in the beginning, so we had to add new ones during the sprint.

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

  > At the beginning we thought that retrospective was part of the sprint, but 
  > we also had to add new tasks so overall the estimation was right and the 
  > actual time spent was a little bit shorter.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

  > Positive: We learned that we should have a task for bug fixing or any other
  > problems that can arise.
  > Negative:  

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?

  > This time we assigned all the tasks in the beginning of the sprint.
  > The communication among us was better during the work and not only
  >  at the end of each task

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

  > We still have to improve task estimation, because we were not able to 
  > point out every task from the beginning.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

  > 1. better task estimation: we should spend more time in the sprint planning
  > to analyze what can go wrong and what tasks can arise
  > 2. improve frontend style: we should spend time on restyling the frontend
  > to make it more user-friendly and nice looking

- One thing you are proud of as a Team !!

  > We are Powerpuff Girls, we overcome all problems that arise without blaming anyone and help each other
